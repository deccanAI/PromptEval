    "  (Example: “The following text is from a 19th‐century medical journal.”)\n",

    "**Definition**: “Prompt Conciseness” refers to how efficiently the prompt communicates its intent, constraints, and expectations-using the fewest necessary words without sacrificing clarity or precision. A concise prompt avoids redundancy, filler words, and overly complex sentence structures while still being fully interpretable by the model. \n",
    "**Applicability**: If style or sensitivity is irrelevant (e.g., “Calculate the area of a circle with radius 3cm.”), mark as N/A with a brief rationale.\n",

    "  - Good(8-10): The prompt is compact and clearly communicates intent, requirements, and role without unnecessary elaboration.\n",
    "  - Average(4-7):  The prompt conveys the main idea but includes minor redundancies or could be made more direct without losing clarity. \n",
    "  - Bad(0-3):  The prompt is overly wordy, vague, or includes irrelevant information that obscures the main task. \n",
