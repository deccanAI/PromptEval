"Broader Goal: Craft a user prompt that instructs an LLM to generate a complete Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new AI-driven language-learning mobile app.

Effective Prompting Axes to be included: Purpose & Persona; Requirements & Restrictions



","As a product manager at an edtech startup, generate a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new AI-driven language-learning mobile app that teaches English to non-native speakers.

Step 1: Conduct a brief market overview (≤100 words) identifying two main competitor apps, their core differentiators, and one unmet user need.  
Step 2: List at least five core features, grouped into “Beginner” and “Intermediate” categories.  
    • If your analysis in Step 1 shows that most users are beginners, add a “Speech Pronunciation Coach” feature under “Beginner”; otherwise, skip that feature.  
Step 3: Write three user personas (one “College Student,” one “Working Professional,” and one “Retiree”), each in exactly two bullet points (name, age range, top pain point, and primary motivation).  
Step 4: Outline two success metrics:  
    • If you decide the primary growth channel is social media, define one metric around “viral referral rate”; otherwise, define a “paid-ad conversion” metric.  

Requirements & Restrictions:  
- The total PRD must be between 600 and 800 words.  
- Use headings (“Market Overview,” “Features,” “User Personas,” “Success Metrics”).  
- Each bullet point in Steps 2–3 must be ≤20 words.  
- If any pricing assumptions are unclear, explicitly state your assumptions in a footnote (no more than 30 words).  ",1.0,0.63,0.815,Yes,8.6,Effective,"{
