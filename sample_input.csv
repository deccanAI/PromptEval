","As a product manager at an edtech startup, generate a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new AI-driven language-learning mobile app that teaches English to non-native speakers.

Step 1: Conduct a brief market overview (≤100 words) identifying two main competitor apps, their core differentiators, and one unmet user need.  
Step 2: List at least five core features, grouped into “Beginner” and “Intermediate” categories.  
    • If your analysis in Step 1 shows that most users are beginners, add a “Speech Pronunciation Coach” feature under “Beginner”; otherwise, skip that feature.  
Step 3: Write three user personas (one “College Student,” one “Working Professional,” and one “Retiree”), each in exactly two bullet points (name, age range, top pain point, and primary motivation).  
Step 4: Outline two success metrics:  
    • If you decide the primary growth channel is social media, define one metric around “viral referral rate”; otherwise, define a “paid-ad conversion” metric.  

Requirements & Restrictions:  
- The total PRD must be between 600 and 800 words.  
- Use headings (“Market Overview,” “Features,” “User Personas,” “Success Metrics”).  
- Each bullet point in Steps 2–3 must be ≤20 words.  
- If any pricing assumptions are unclear, explicitly state your assumptions in a footnote (no more than 30 words).  "

","Step 1: Write a short market summary identifying two competitor language-learning apps and one unmet need.  
Step 2: Create a feature list under “Beginner,” “Intermediate,” and “Advanced” headings.  
   • If most users are beginners, include a “Speech Pronunciation Coach” under “Beginner”; otherwise skip it.  
Step 3: Draft three user personas (College Student, Working Professional, Retiree), each in two bullet points.  
Step 4: Define two success metrics; if you choose social media as the main channel, include “viral referral rate”; otherwise include “paid‐ad conversion.”

If you aren’t sure about pricing, make a note of any assumptions. Use bullet points for everything.  "
